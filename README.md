# Tokenized Music Royalty Distribution

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform revolutionizes how music royalties are tracked, collected, and distributed to rights holders. By leveraging smart contracts and tokenization, the system creates transparent, efficient, and accurate royalty payments while reducing administrative overhead and payment delays common in traditional royalty management.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Artist Verification Contract

This contract establishes and maintains verified identities of music creators within the ecosystem.

**Key Features:**
- Identity verification through multiple authentication methods
- Artist profile management with discography links
- Rights holder status verification
- Collaboration history documentation
- Management and representation relationships
- Digital signature implementation
- Dispute resolution protocols for identity claims

### Composition Registration Contract

This contract serves as a decentralized registry for musical works, establishing verifiable ownership.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive metadata storage (title, composers, lyricists, publishers)
- Split sheet management for multiple contributors
- Version control for derivative works
- Unique digital fingerprinting for each composition
- Copyright registration integration
- Sample and interpolation documentation
- Publishing agreement terms encoding
- Tokenization of ownership percentages

### Usage Tracking Contract

This contract monitors and records music consumption across various platforms and media channels.

**Key Features:**
- API integration with major streaming platforms
- Standardized play count verification
- Cross-platform data aggregation
- Real-time usage analytics dashboard
- Radio and public performance tracking
- Sync licensing activity monitoring
- Data validation through oracle networks
- Audit trail for usage reports

### Payment Distribution Contract

This contract automates royalty calculations and payments based on verified usage data and ownership records.

**Key Features:**
- Smart split implementation based on registered rights
- Automated payment scheduling (monthly, quarterly, custom)
- Multiple cryptocurrency payment options
- Fiat currency conversion options
- Tax withholding calculations
- Minimum payment threshold settings
- Transparent fee structure
- Payment history ledger
- Advance and recoupment management
